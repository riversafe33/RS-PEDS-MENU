Complete Script to Use Peds In-Game

1 - Players Command /pedmenu to preview peds, submit a request to an admin, and manage the ones you have already been authorized to use.

2 - Admin Command /pedadmin to accept, reject, or remove a player's ped.

3 - If you wear a bird skin and press space, you can fly, and near the ground, pressing space again makes you land.

The script is already preconfigured, but you can add more peds if you notice any missing in the config.lua.

4 - Pressing R reloads the weapon and unlocks the ped.
